  <h2><span>Part one</span> Customize a card with theme settings</h2>
  <p>
    Over on the opposite side of the screen you'll see a USWDS Card component. Let's customize this card a bit for our site. Weâ€™ll start by using theme settings to make simple customizations.
  </p>
  <h3 class="step">View available theme settings.</h3>
  <p class="step-description">
    Visit the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/card/#component-settings-card">USWDS Card component settings table</a> to see a list of available settings. Settings allow you to apply a global theme to USWDS components and styles without modifying CSS. Today's we're going to give our card a light golden look. 
  </p>
  <h3 class="step">Customize border settings</h3>
  <p class="step-description">
    Let's start but updating the border to remove the border and give the card a rounder border radius.
  </p>
  <p class="step-description">
    We want to give our card... TKTKTKTKTKTKT
  </p>
  <div class="editor">
    <h4 class="filename"><span class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">description</span> _theme/_uswds-theme.scss</h4>
<pre class="blur">@use "uswds-core" with (
  ...
</pre><pre class="add">  $theme-card-border-radius: 2,
  $theme-card-border-width: 0</pre>
<pre class="blur">);</pre>
  </div>
  <h3 class="step">Customize type settings</h3>
  <p class="step-description">
    Next lets update the typeset of our header to use a <strong>sans</strong> font and increase the size.
  </p>
  <div class="editor">
    <h4 class="filename"><span class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">description</span> _theme/_uswds-theme.scss</h4>
<pre class="blur">@use "uswds-core" with (
  ...
  $theme-card-border-color: "indigo-30",
  $theme-card-border-radius: 3,
  $theme-card-border-width: 1,</pre>
<pre class="add">  $theme-card-header-typeset: "sans" "xl" 3
</pre><pre class="blur">);</pre>
  </div>
  <p class="step-description">
    Save, wait for he Sass to compile, and do a hard reload and you'll see the the updated border and font settings shape the card component! All without having to write any custom CSS.
  </p>
  
  <p class="step-description">
    Maybe there are additional changes your team would like to make that are not available in theme settings. In the next section we'll take a look at adding custom styles to USWDS.
